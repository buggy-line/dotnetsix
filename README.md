# C# 10 Language features

## Overview

In this repository I will try to go over a few scenarios that make use of the new features introduced with C# 10 (available in .NET 6 solutions).

Before going through the code samples and documentation available here, you should read the oficial documentation from Microsoft available below:

* [What's new in C# 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-10)
* [Welcome to C# 10](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/welcome-to-csharp-10/)

 Now that you've familiarized yourself with the official docs, have a look through the next sections. The structure is [in progress] with .md files discussing the features + code files as xUnit tests or otherwise.

[Top level statements](gdf)
 [File scoped namespaces](docs/FileScopedNamespaces.md) 
 [Global and implicit usings](docs/GlobalAndImplicitUsings.md)
